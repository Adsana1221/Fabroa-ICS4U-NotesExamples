## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `bin`: the folder to maintain compiled binary files (i.e .class files)
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources(i.e .java files)
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies (i.e .jar files)

## Getting Started
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone or import your fork to your development environment (i.e repl.it or VS Code)
3. In your local repository, add an upstream remote by entering the following in the terminal. 
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/SACHSTech/Fabroa-ICS4U-NotesExamples.git
```

### Getting Updates from the parent fork
When changes are made to the parent fork (i.e new notes), you will need to pull the changes to your repository
```
git pull upstream main
```
